# clj-reindeer-example

A RSS reader implemented in Clojure with Vaadin 7 as a frontend framework.

This example is based on Tobias Bayer's [Clojure/Vaadin RSS reader](https://github.com/codebrickie/rsscljvaadin) and uses [clj-reindeer](https://github.com/feldi/clj-reindeer) instead of Clojure's Java interop to access Vaadin functionality.
